				<p>I was born in Michigan, lived in Illinois as a small child and then ended up back in Michigan for most of my life.
						I graduated from Rockford High School. Then I studied all things computers at Grand Rapids Community 
						College and Ferris State University.</p>
						
				<p>I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.harriscomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harris Computer</a> 
						where I work on a property tax application called <a href="https://www.aumentumtech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aumentum.</a> I mainly work on 
						assessment calculations that keep track of values and events on people's homes, but I do other stuff as well.  You can see
						my <a href="resume.html">r&#233;sum&#233;</a> for more details.</p>
			
				<p>For my hobbies, I am first and foremost a programmer, so I am always learning new things about coding.
						I also keep my Spanish and math skills fresh. When time permits, I enjoy learning about electrical engineering 
						and try to exercise regularly.</p>
